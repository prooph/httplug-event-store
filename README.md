## Overview

Prooph Event Store is capable of persisting event messages that are organized in streams. `Prooph\EventStore\EventStore`
itself is a facade for different persistence adapters (see the list below) and adds event-driven hook points for `Prooph\EventStore\Plugin\Plugin`s
which make the Event Store highly customizable.

The httplug event store is an implementation that uses httplug to communicate with the [HTTP-API](https://github.com/prooph/event-store-http-api/).

## Usage

This example uses Guzzle6 httplug adapter

```php
$messageFactory = new \Prooph\Common\Messaging\FQCNMessageFactory();
$messageConverter = new \Prooph\Common\Messaging\NoOpMessageConverter();
$httplug = new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client();
$uri = new \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Uri('http:/localhost:8080');

$eventStore = new \Prooph\EventStore\Httplug\HttplugEventStore($messageFactory, $messageConverter, $httpPlug, $uri);

$streamEvents = $eventStore->load(new StreamName('test-stream'));
```
